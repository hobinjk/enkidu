Enkidu
======

Simple example of using the File API to provide easy, worry-free
encryption. As a twist, it uses an emscripten-ized Blowfish
which is about 50 times faster than an unoptimized implementation.

TODO
----
Run Blowfish in a WebWorker and show progress instead of blocking
(even though encryption has yet to take a noticeable amount of time).
